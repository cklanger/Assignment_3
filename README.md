PHYS 50733 - Assignment 3 Solutions

problem1.py reads the data from stm.txt and makes a density plot.

problem2.py computes e^{-x} four different ways, and plots the results. (i) using the math function; (ii) using the Maclaurin series expansion about x=0;
(iii) using an alternate series expansion; and (iv) using e^{-x}=1/e^x.

Langer_problem_3.py computes the roots of a specific quadratic equation two different ways, then asks for the coefficients of 
a general quadratic ax^2+bx+c=0, returning the two roots. The general method eliminates the presence of numerical errors for
small a or c i.e., the case when b^2 << 4ac.
